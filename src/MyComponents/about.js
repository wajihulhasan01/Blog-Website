      <motion.p variants={item}>
        Welcome to <b>Code Canvas</b> â€” where developers write, share, and grow together.
        <br /><br />
        We built Code Canvas with one goal in mind: <b>to empower developers to tell their stories, share their code, and build a community through writing</b>. Whether youâ€™re documenting your first "Hello World", breaking down a complex algorithm, or sharing thoughts on the future of tech, this is your space to do it.
      </motion.p>

      <motion.h1 variants={item} className="text-2xl my-4">Why Code Canvas?</motion.h1>

      <motion.p variants={item}>
        In a world flooded with tutorials and docs, we wanted a place that feels more personal, more developer-first. Code Canvas is:<br /><br />
        ðŸ§  <b>Built for Devs</b> â€“ Syntax highlighting, Markdown support, GitHub integration, and code snippets that actually look good.  <br />
        ðŸ“š <b>Knowledge Hub</b> â€“ From junior devs to seasoned engineers, everyone has something to teach (and learn). <br />
        ðŸŒ± <b>Community-Driven</b> â€“ Leave comments, start conversations, and connect with other devs who get it.  <br />
        ðŸš€ <b>Open & Evolving</b> â€“ We believe in transparency and improvement. Expect frequent updates, new tools, and an evolving platform.

      <motion.p variants={item}>
        Weâ€™re developers too. We know the thrill of solving a bug at 2AM, the satisfaction of a clean refactor, and the joy of sharing a cool snippet with someone who <i>actually</i> gets it.<br /><br />
